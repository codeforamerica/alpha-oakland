When applying for a permit, please bring the following information with you:

Cost of Permit

The cost of an Obstruction Permit varies by length of days of the pod/unit placement, the number of parking spaces required and whether its a metered or non-metered space.

For example, a permit for one day and one non-metered (25 foot) parking space costs approximately $101, while a permit for two days and two metered spaces costs about $240. The Permit Center accepts cash, checks (payable to the City of Oakland) and most major credit cards. For more information, please call the Permit Center at (510) 238-3443. 

An Obstruction Permit allows you to place the pod, portable storage unit or moving truck in the public right of way in a designated parking space for a designated period of time. The Obstruction Permit notifies the neighboring property owners that specified spaces will not be available for the permitted period of time. You may only block the frontage of the parcel you are moving from or to. You need to post the NO PARKING sign(s) that you receive as part of the Obstruction Permit at least 72 hours (3 days) prior to your start date in a residential area. A parking space is typically 25 linear feet.
