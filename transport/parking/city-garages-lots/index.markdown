Parking garages and off-street parking lots represent an essential component of Oakland's parking systems. The City's off-street parking facilities are designed and operated to work in concert with on-street parking.

To find a City-owned garage or lot near your work place or favorite shop or restaurant, check out the Oakland Parking Map below. 

Inquiries concerning a particular garage should be directed to the parking operator. Contact information can be found on the map below by clicking on the “P” linked to the garage.

Inquiries concerning monthly parking permits available on a limited basis at certain metered surface lots should be directed to the City by calling (510) 238-6154.
