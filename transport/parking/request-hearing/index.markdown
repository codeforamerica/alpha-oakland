If you are not satisfied with the decision/results of your administrative review, you can request an Administrative Hearing. You can schedule a hearing before an impartial Hearing Officer either in person or in writing within 21 days from the date of receiving your administrative review results. A hearing can be requested in person or by mail to:

Parking Citation Assistance Center â€“ Hearing Dept. 
250 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, Suite 6300
Oakland, CA 94612

In order to have a hearing, you must pay a deposit which is equal to the amount of fine prior to scheduling a hearing. If you cannot afford the deposit, please complete the Hearing Deposit Waiver Form or contact us at (800) 500-6484 prior to the due date to request a hearing deposit fee waiver.
