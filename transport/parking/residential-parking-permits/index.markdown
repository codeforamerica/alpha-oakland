<!--Who can apply for an RRP?

Certain residential neighborhoods that border commercial areas within the City participate in the Residential Parking Permit (RPP) program. Vehicles displaying the correct permit are able to park in that neighborhood for an extended period of time.
Parking permits are issued to a vehicle registered to an eligible address, not to a person. So if you move into a neighborhood that has RPP, you'll need to update the vehicle's registration to the new address with DMV before applying for a permit. Please remember to update both your vehicle registration and driver license as these are two separate records with DMV. To update online, please visit http://dmv.ca.gov/online/onlinesvcs.htm. Print out the update confirmation and submit it as part of your supporting documents.
The City of Oakland requires that all delinquent parking tickets be cleared (paid or adjudicated) prior to issuance of any permit for a particular vehicle. To obtain citation information or pay your citation, call (800) 500-6484 or click here to go to the online payment system.
