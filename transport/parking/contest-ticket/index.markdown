You must contest your ticket within 21 calendar days of the date of issuance.

Emails are not an accepted form of communication for contesting a parking ticket. If you wish to contest a ticket, you can do it in the following ways:

Online

Follow the easy step-by-step instructions and upload up to three documents that provide evidence to support your written testimony. Please wait 48 hours from the time of issuance to ensure your citation is uploaded into the online system.
