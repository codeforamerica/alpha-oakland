Smart meters

The City of Oakland has converted all 3,800 existing single-space parking meters across Oakland to state-of-the-art Smart Parking Meters.

The Smart Parking Meters allow motorists to pay for parking using coins, credit/debit cards or their cell phones.

To setup an account and download the Parkmobile pay-by-phone mobile app, visit www.parkmobile.com. Accounts may also be setup by calling (877) 727-5718. Please note the vendor does charge a 35Â¢ fee per transaction. Motorists who use this app can add additional minutes to their meter directly from their phones and opt-in to receive a notification 15 minutes prior to meter expiration.

Multi-space parking meters

Parking kiosks accept payment by coin or credit/debit card. After paying, place the receipt on your dashboard so the date and time are visible.

Unexpired receipts from these machines may be used at any metered parking spot until the time printed on the receipt.

Many of the kiosks also accept pay-by-phone via Parkmobile. See additional information to the left.
