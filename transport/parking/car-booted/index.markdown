If your vehicle is booted, do not attempt to drive the vehicle as severe damage may occur to your vehicle.

A sticker will be prominently displayed on a window of your vehicle indicating your vehicle has been immobilized.
Instructions in English, Chinese and Spanish will also be placed on your vehicle with a telephone number to the Help Center which operates 24/7. Phone assistance is available in multiple languages. 

If you do not have a credit card, you can pay your delinquent parking tickets in cash at the Parking Citation Assistance Center, 250 Frank H. Ogawa Plaza, 6th Floor. Payment plan options are available. Please call (800) 500-6484 for more information.

Fines can be paid over the phone with a credit/debit card or e-check. The owner will then receive a six-digit code which will release the boot and allow safe removal of the device. Live operators at the Help Center assist callers with payment options and boot removal steps. The vehicle owner is also given a location to return the boot to. In most cases, motorists can be back on the road in about five minutes.

The parking boot program targets the most serious parking violators who have five (5) or more delinquent parking tickets. It was introduced as an alternative to towing, thereby saving vehicle owners from having to visit four separate locations during normal business hours to reclaim their vehicle.
